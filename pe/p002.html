<h3>Even Fibonacci numbers</h3> 
<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2">pe link</a> </p>
<p>This simple problem requires look at the even terms. It is straight forward to see that every third term is even. Thus an expression 
for every third term is desired. A bit of manipulation immediately shows that </p>
$$ F_{n} = 4F_{n-3} + F_{n-6} \Rightarrow a_{n} = 4a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$$

<p>  with the initial condition of $a_{0} = 0, a_{1} = 2$. The solution is now very simple to code.</p>
