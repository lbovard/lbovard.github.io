<h3>Neutron Stars for Undergraduates</h3>
<p><i>2003 - Silbar, Reddy</i></p>
<p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.1703544">DOI</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/0309041">arXiv</a></p>
<p>This very nice introductory paper that derives the basic equation of state for a Fermi gas in increasing complexity, eventually ending with the equation of state for a Fermi gas with nuclear interactions.</p>

<p>The most interesting argument that is presented is the one that argues why there must be a maximum mass for compact objects. The argument is very simple, in the TOV equations the prevention of the collapse due to gravity is due to a pressure that prevents collapse. However, as we increase the mass, i.e. increase the density, the energy density also increases, which increases the gravitational attraction. However in order to prevent collapse this increase in gravitational attraction must be counterbalanced by an increase in the pressure. But, because the sound speed is defined </p>
$$ c_{s} \propto \frac{\partial p}{\partial \epsilon} \le 1,$$

<p> which by relativity is finite. Hence eventually we will reach a point where we can no longer increase the pressure and the gravitational attraction wins. Here, the object will collapse and thus we have a maximum mass that is allowed before collapse.</p>
