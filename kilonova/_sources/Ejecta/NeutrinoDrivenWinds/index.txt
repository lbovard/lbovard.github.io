Scaling Relation
----------------

For back of the envelope calculations, it is useful to have at hand the scaling
relation for neutrino driven wind.  This was first calculated by `Qian and
Woosley 1996 <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9611094>`_ who, using
a 1D steady-state Newtonian model, derived an analytic expression (Eq. 58) for the 
mass loss rate from neutrino driven wind as

.. math::

  \dot{M} \propto L_{\nu}^{5/3} \epsilon_{\nu}^{10/3} R^{5/3} M^{-2}.

Subsequent improvements by `Thompson et al. 2001
<https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105004v2>`_ using a 1D steady-state general
relativistic model suggested similar scaling. Further improvements
