Basic Thermodynamics
--------------------

Consider the expansion of pressure, :math:`p(\rho,T)`, where :math:`\rho` is the
rest-mass density and :math:`T` is the temperature. Expanding this out as differentials
yields the following relationship between the differentials

.. math::

 dp = \frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\bigg|_{\rho}\delta T 
 +  \frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\bigg|_{T}\delta \rho.


By diving this expression by various differentials, such as radius, yields a
differential expression for various identities involving the pressure.

Stefan-Boltzmann Law
--------------------

The Stefan-Boltzmann law relates the temperature of a blackbody to the power
radiated away. In astronomy instead of using power, the term luminosity is 
used instead. The law states

.. math::

 L = \sigma A T^{4},

where :math:`\sigma` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, :math:`A` is the surface
area, and :math:`T` is the temperature. Since power is energy
