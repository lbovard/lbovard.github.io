<h1>Coupon's Collector Problem</h1>
<p>The coupon collector's problem is the following problem: suppose a company
is offering $N$ coupons in a giveaway in a maga. The probability of recieving
any coupon is equal, i.e. $p=1/N$. What is the expected number of coupons we
must collect before we obtain all $N$ coupons?</p>

<p>We need to find the expected value of getting the $i$th coupon. Suppose, for
now, that the probability of finding the $i$th coupon is $p_{i}$. What is the
probability of finding the coupon on the $k$th attempt? It is clear that this
is $(1-p_{i})^{k-1}p_{i}$, i.e. the first $k-1$ attempts all fail, and it
succeeds on the $k$th. This is the geometric distribution. So to find the
expected number, we need to compute</p>
$$E(p) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}k(1-p_{i})^{k}p_{i} = \frac{1}{p_{i}}.$$
