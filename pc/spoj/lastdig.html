<h3>The last digit</h3> 
<p><a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/LASTDIG/">spoj link</a> </p>
<p>This problem is asking to solve the following modular problem</p>
$$a^{b} \bmod 10$$ 
<p>where $0\le a \le 20$ and $0\le b \le 2,147,483,000$ (which is almost $2^{31}$)</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>This problem is very easy when exploiting the properties of modular arithemetic. The following is a trivial observation</p>
$$(10+a)^{b} \equiv a^{b} \bmod 10$$
<p>where $0\le a \le 9$. So we only need to know how the powers of a single digit number behaves.</p>
$$\begin{array}{c|c}
a & a^{1,2,3,4...} \bmod 10 \\
0 & 0\\
1 & 1\\
2 & 2,4,8,2\\
3 & 3,9,7,1,3\\
4 & 4,6,4\\
5 & 5 \\
6 & 6 \\
7 & 7,9,3,1,7 \\
8 & 8,4,2,6,8 \\
9 & 9,1,9
\end{array}$$
<p> Notice that as long as $b\ge 1$ the maximum period of repetition is $4$. So we only need to know $b\bmod 4$ to get our answer. However there is one catch here and that if $b\equiv 0\bmod 4$ we actually want to use $4$ and not $0$ since $a^{0}=1$ which is not what we want. The following code now computes the answer
<pre>
<code>
if(b%4==0 && b!=0) {b=4;}
else {b=b%4;}
printf("%d\n",(int)pow(a,b)%10);
</code>
</pre>
<p>In principle these answers could be stored in a precomputed array but for this simple problem, the <code>pow</code> function is more than sufficient. It also handles the annoying edge cases of $0^{0}=1$ nicely. My two solutions that use a precomputed array and the <code>pow</code> have a runtime of $0.0$s so there is no advantage. </p>
