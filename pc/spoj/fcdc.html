<h3>Factorial Modulo</h3> 
<p><a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/FCDC/">spoj link</a> </p>
<p>The problem is looking to find the total number of values of $l!$ such that $a\vert l!$ and $b \nmid l!$ with $a\le b$. This problem is really looking to solve </p>
$$n! \equiv 0 \bmod a $$
<p>for a given $a,b$. Then the answer is simply the difference between these two values. This operation is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempner_function">Kempner function</a>.</p>

<h4>Simple Solution</h4>
<p>Unfortunately I was unable to find an exact formula for it and for this solution, the simplest brute force solution works and gives a good time.</p>

<pre>
<code>
int kempner(int i) {
  long int s,k;
  //i is the number we wwant to find n! mod i =0
  s=1;
  k=1;
  while(s%i>0){
    s=(s*k)%i;
    k+=1;
  }
  k--;//get the correct k
  return k;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This above function works very nicely for the above bounds and solves the problem in a reasonable time. On SPoJ my solution took $0.13$s with this method.</p>

<h4>Advanced solution</h4>

<p>As an example, consider the number $a=2^{6}3^{5}5^{3}7^{2}=95256000$. Notice that if the factor is $p^{a}$ then $ap$ is at most the number needed to contain enough powers of $p$. Thus we need to have at least $6$ factors of $2$ so at most we need a $12$. For $3$ we need at most $15$, $5$ requires $15$ as well, and $7$ requires $14$. Thus the answer is $15$. However, note that there is something we have neglected about the number $2$. If we have $2^{6}$ we actually only need $10$ since there is are two powers of $2$ in $4$. As said, $pa$ is sufficient but not always the optimal answer.</p>


<p>To fix this problem we must find the smallest $n$ such that $n!\equiv 0 \bmod p^{a}$. In general this is probably difficult but because of the restrictions on the maximum value the following simple function will work</p>
<pre>
<code>
int pcount(int p, int a){ 
  int i;
  int k=0;
  int s=0;
  int c=0;
  for(i=1;i<=a;i++) {
    s=p*i;
    while( (s%p)==0) {
      s/=p;
      c++;
    }   
    printf("%d %d\n",p*i,c);
    if(c>=a) {
      return (p*i);
    }   
  }
  return (p*a);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>This function works by simply looping over the multiples of $p$ and then checking how many times we can divide by $p$ and exiting if we reach $a$.</p>

<p>The solution is now very simple. To compute the Kempner number compute the prime factorisation. Then find the smallest number $n_{i}$ such that each prime factor has $n_{i}! \equiv 0 \bmod p_{i}^{a_{i}}$. Then simply take the largest value of this set. On SPoJ my solution took $0.00$s with this method. </p>
