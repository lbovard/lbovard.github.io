<h3>Non-bouncy numbers</h3> 
<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=113">pe link</a> </p>
<p>This problem asks to find non-bouncy numbers, where a non-bouncy number is defined to be a number in which its digits are either increasing or decreasing left-to-right. For example, $134468$ is increasing, while $66420$ is decreasing, and $1111$ satisfies both criteria.</p>

<p>There are two solutions, one using recursion, and the other using combinatorics. I prefer the recursion solution, although the combinatorics solution is cleaner and provides an exact answer.</p>

<h4>Recursive Solution</h4>

<p>Denote by $f(n,k)$ the number of increasing numbers with $n$ being the first
digit and having $k$-digits.  It is easy to see that the following criteria hold</p>
\begin{align}
f(0,k) &= 0,\\
f(i,1) &= 1,\\
f(j,k) &= \sum_{i=j}^{9} f(i,k-1).
\end{align}
<p> In other words, if add another digit to a $k$ digit number, say $3$, all
numbers of $k$ digits that begin with $3$ can be added. Likewise, let us define
$g(n,k)$ be the number of decreasing numbers with $k$-digits and $n$ begin the
first digit. It is easy to see that </p> \begin{align}
g(0,k) &= 1,\\
g(i,1) &= 1,\\
g(j,k) &= \sum_{i=0}^{j} g(i,k-1).
\end{align}
<p>Here the $g(0,k)=1$ since the last digits can always be $0$ so we have to
ensure that we count them. The only additional piece is to remove the numbers
that are counted twice, i.e. numbers of the form $11111$. This is easy to
enumerate as $9k$ since there are only $9$ possible $k$-digit numbers that
satisfiy the criteria, $9$ $(k-1)$-digit numbers, and so on. Thus the solution is
of the form</p>
$$ T(k) = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{i=1}^{9}f(i,j) + \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{i=1}^{9}g(i,j) - 9k.$$
<h4>Combinatorics Solution</h4>

<p>A very clever combinatorics argument from <a
href="https://mathschallenge.net/full/never_decreasing_digits">here</a> can
give the exact answer. Denote by $0$ an increase counter starting from $0$ and
by $1$ the value of that counter. So for example the binary string
$0011010010000$ represents the number $2235$. Here all $9$ 0s must be used and
we must place a $1$ $k$ times. Thus the answer is simply selecting how many
ways we can choose $k$ ones from $9+k$ 0s and 1s. This can be written as</p>
$$\binom{9+k}{k}-1.$$
<p> Decreasing follows a similar argument, taking care this time that there are 10 digits instead of 9, </p>
$$\binom{10+k}{k}-1-k.$$
<p> and likewise we need to remove the duplicates which are $9k$ as before.
Thus the solution is</p>
$$\binom{10+k}{k}+\binom{9+k}{k} - 2 - 10k.$$
