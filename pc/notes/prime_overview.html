<h3>Generating primes</h3> 
<p>The generation of primes is used a lot in programming contests. Furthermore, it is used a lot in general number theory, so knowing how to generate them quickly is an important tool to have.</p>

<p>An important first step in the generation of primes is to note that to check primality of a number $x$ we only need to check up to $\sqrt{x}$. Using a square root involves floating point and we would like to avoid that, so instead of checking up to $\sqrt{x}$ is simply faster to check up to $i*i \le n$.</p>

<h3>Prime counting function</h3> 
<p>The prime counting function $\Pi(x)$ is a very useful function as it tells us how many primes there are that are $\le x$. A very important mathematical result, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem">prime number theorem</a>, states that
</p>

$$ \Pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}.$$

<p>Some exact values that are useful in programming contests are</p>

$$\begin{array}{c|c|c}
N & N^{2} &\Pi(N) \\ \hline
1000 & 10^{6} & 168 \\
10000 & 10^{8} &1229\\
\sim 46341 & 2^{31}-1 & 4792
\end{array}$$

<h3>Prime factorisation</h3>
<p>As can be seen, there aren't many primes for small values of $N$, and since prime factorisation is used a lot, an efficient algorithm for relatively small values of $N$ is good to have handy. For small values it is sufficient to simply pre-compute all the values to avoid needing to generate the primes.</p>
