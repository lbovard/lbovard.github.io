<h1>Subplots</h1>
<p>A commonly used feature of matplotlib is the ability to create subplots. Fortunately matplotlib provides many ways to do this. Unfortuantely, matplotlib provides many ways to do this. </p>

<p>It is important to recall the figure of how matplotlib is set-up. There is a figure which is the entire plotting area and each plot has a set of axes and hence a figure can have multiple axes. Thus setting up each axes in a way we want is critical. In my opinion, the object-oriented nature of matplotlib is essential to understand the various commands. Unfortunately many example use the default <code>plt.subplot</code>-type styling and while this is good for quick plots, I believe it obscures the nature of the subplotting and also does not generalise well.</p> 
<h2>add_subplot</h2>
<p>The first way to add subplots is directly through manipulating the figure object using the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure.add_subplot">figure.add_subplot</a> option.</p>

<p>In the following code, we show a simple way to create subplots directly from the figure object.</p>
<code>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
<br>
fig=plt.figure() <br>
ax0=fig.add_subplot(2,2,1)<br>
ax1=fig.add_subplot(2,2,2)<br>
ax2=fig.add_subplot(2,2,3)<br>
ax3=fig.add_subplot(2,2,4)<br>
plt.show()
</code>
<p>This code will produce the following figure</p>

<p>Thus we have created a 2x2 grid of subplots, labeled ax0 through ax3. From here, we could then control the axes properties directly through the individual axes objects.</p>
